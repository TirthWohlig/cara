              Fashion speaks volumes to me, as it does to millions world-over,
              and as I delved deeper into this beautiful yet dynamic universe, I
              saw a gap. After months of research, development and obsessing
              over the solution to this problem, my team and I built Palettier.
              A solution and platform that simplifies the essence of
              customisation finding the perfect outfit should be fun, simple and
              hassle-free; customising the perfect one - even more so. Thatâ€™s
              where Palettier comes in. Our platform lets you visualise what
              your ideal outfit looks like, choose from a range of distinct
              brands and enables our brands to cater to your specific needs.
